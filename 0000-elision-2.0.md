# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A set of related changes that aim to lighten the annotation burden
associated with structs that contain references, as well as tempering
some confusing cases that arise with the current elision rules:

- Inferring the `T: 'a` annotations that are currently required on structs.
- Permit eliding lifetimes in structs if the struct has a single
  lifetime parameter.
- Introducing a "single tick" notation `Foo<'>` that can be used to
  indicate the presence of elided lifetimes in various settings:
  - **Struct declarations:** such as `struct Iter<', T> { vec: &[T], index: usize }`.
  - **Elided lifetime arguments in function signatures:**
      - Rather than writing `fn foo(&self) -> Ref<i32>`, one might write
        `fn foo(&self) -> Ref<', i32>`, which makes it clear that `self` will remain
        borrowed so long as the return value is in used.
      - Similarly, rather than writing `fn foo(&self, r: Ref<i32>)`,
        one might write `fn foo(&self, r: Ref<', i32>)`, which makes
        it clear `Ref` carries lifetime data.
      - In these contexts, the `'` can "stand-in" for any number of lifetime
        parameters.
- Deprecate fully eliding the lifetime parameters on structs (e.g.,
  `Ref<i32>`) in favor of `Ref<', i32>`.
      - FEEDBACK REQUESTED: Everywhere? Or just in fn arguments?

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

There are a number of proposed changes that all work in tandem to
achieve the full effect, but which are somewhat independent. This
section is therefore broken up to discuss them separately.

### Inferring outlives annotations

- Global analysis performed at same time as variance
- Should be a fairly straightforward data flow based on the WF constraints

### Permit eliding lifetimes in struct/enum/union declarations and type aliases

- Only if type has exactly one parameter
- Elided lifetime defaults to that single lifetime parameter

### Allow single-tick notation to be used in struct/enum/union declarations and type aliases

- so `struct Foo<', T>` is as if you wrote `struct Foo<'a, T>`
- note that this relies on inferring outlives annotations to work
- Also usable in type aliases: `type Ref<', T> = &T`
- Why not trait declarations?
    - I can't find a place you might want to reference it
        - e.g., `trait Foo<'> { fn foo(&self) }`, the `&self` already has an elision
        - only place I can imagine is `trait Foo<', T> where &T: Eq` or something,
          or perhaps `trait Foo<'> { type X = &i32; }` but both of those seem
          pretty weak

### Allow single-tick notation to be used in types

- Meaning of `Foo<', T>` in each context:
    - struct, union, or enum body and type aliases
    - static or const (becomes `'static`, as per RFC 1623
    - fn arguments
    - fn return type
    - fn body
    - (where else can types appear?)
- In general, the rule is "what it would mean today if you elided
  everything".  If the case of struct/union/enum body, full elision is
  not permitted, but we allow it as part of this RFC.
